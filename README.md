## Introduction

The motivation for producing stock screeners is that this service either does not exist or is premium / payed only for the Swedish brokers and banks that I know of. The only good free screeners I am aware of is provided by Yahoo. 
  
I might add a screener for 'twelve minus one' month price-momentum at a later time. That one is useful for the same reason.
